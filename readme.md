* Linkedin_JS_ForWebDevs  -  This is a group of exercise tasks for the linked in course JS for web developers.
                             Some are follow along, and some are creative task Challenges, where you devise your own solution, these may have comments.


* Task List Javascript Project - This project starts with a task list and a text entry bar.  You can add new tasks, edit them, delete them and save the edits you make to them.
                                 you can also delete the tasks you have created in the list.  One task remains there always as default. Once refreshed it resets the page,
                                 and the task list is blank again, save for the first default.

* 2nd Javascript Project
