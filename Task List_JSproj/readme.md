# Introduction


This is a realitively simple JS web app that I have created. 


*  It allows you to type and add events or tasks you plan to do in an input bar and then adds them to a list below.

*  You have an add button to add the task;

*  You have a delete button to delete existing tasks;

*  You have an edit button to edit task text;

*  Once you have refreshed the HTML page, it resets the list back to blank;

*  There is one Default task that always stays there as an example;

*  There is a save button that appears once you edit a task to save the changes made.
